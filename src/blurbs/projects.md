I have entirely too many projects. Check them out!
<br>

## Table of Contents

## Visualizer? I hardly know 'er!

I've made a number of visualizers to illustrate different concepts in Computer Science.
<br>

### Sorting Algorithms

Based on lots of great youtube videos [my sort visualizer](https://assert-justice.github.io/sorts_visualizer/) isn't exactly breaking new ground but it's real easy to extend! I made it for a lecture on the topic, see below.
<br>

### Conway's Game of Life

There are many game of life sims but [this one](https://assert-justice.github.io/conway_visualized/) is mine. Again I made it for a lecture and again I made the code as easy to understand as possible.
<br>

### The Gluesniff Library

I made [a npm library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gluesniff) for making resolution-independent interactive visualizations. It's bad, buggy, has a stupid name, and it has no documentation! Just like a real npm package!
