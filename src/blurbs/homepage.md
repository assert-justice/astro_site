## Tech Tutoring for the Rest of Us
Hi! You know, learning to program is hard at the best of times. And these aren't the best of times. Misfit Coding is a home for folks for whom a traditional university course or bootcamp might be a struggle.

If you are:

- Neurodivergent
- Disabled
- LGBTQA+
- BIPOC
- Disabled
- Any other marginalized group

then you don't need me to tell you you're going to have a harder time then some cis, white, het, male, jackass.

This is a place for you.
